## Philosophy
Cauth is a project focusing on providing simple authentication and authorization API to self host and integrate with your application. The main difference between it and other similar services/projects is that it focuses on being as compact as it can by default with an option to build up your own system on top of it. For example it doesn't come with an email confirmation system, if you want one, you can go and implement it yourself with the events API (tho trivial and widely used things like that will propably be a plug-n-play projects in future).

## Your concerns
If you are concerned about why is there so many dependencies judging by this project's philosophy, keep in mind the fact that this is just in development for now, a lot of things are prototyped.
There are plans to rewrite or narrow most of the dependencies to just what is needed, it just takes time (even more accounting for the fact that I have more things to worry abount in life apart from this project).
Thanks for understanding :).
